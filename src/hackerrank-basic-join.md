Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.  
  
Write a query to help Eve.  
  
***Note***: Print "NULL"  as the name if the grade is less than 8.

# Top Competitors  
  
Julia just finished conducting a coding contest, and she needs your help assembling the leaderboard! Write a query to print the respective hacker_id and name of hackers who achieved full scores for more than one challenge. Order your output in descending order by the total number of challenges in which the hacker earned a full score. If more than one hacker received full scores in same number of challenges, then sort them by ascending hacker_id.

# Ollivander's Inventory  
  
Harry Potter and his friends are at Ollivander's with Ron, finally replacing Charlie's old broken wand.  
  
Hermione decides the best way to choose is by determining the minimum number of gold galleons needed to buy each non-evil wand of high power and age. Write a query to print the id, age, coins_needed, and power of the wands that Ron's interested in, sorted in order of descending power. If more than one wand has same power, sort the result in order of descending age.  
  
***Input Format***  
  
The following tables contain data on the wands in Ollivander's inventory:  
  
Wands: The id is the id of the wand, code is the code of the wand, coins_needed is the total number of gold galleons needed to buy the wand, and power denotes the quality of the wand (the higher the power, the better the wand is).  
  
![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/19502/1458538092-b2a8163a74-ScreenShot2016-03-08at12.13.39AM.png)  
  
Wands_Property: The code is the code of the wand, age is the age of the wand, and is_evil denotes whether the wand is good for the dark arts. If the value of is_evil is 0, it means that the wand is not evil. The mapping between code and age is one-one, meaning that if there are two pairs, (code1, age1) and (code2, age2), then code1 != code2 and age1 != age2.

# Challenges  
  
Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.  
  
***Input Format***  
  
The following tables contain challenge data:  
  
Hackers: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the hacker.

***Explanation***  
  
For Sample Case 0, we can get the following details:  
![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/19506/1458521677-fd04c384c0-ScreenShot2016-03-21at6.07.38AM.png)  
  
Students 5077 and 62743 both created 4 challenges, but the maximum number of challenges created is 6 so these students are excluded from the result.  
  
For Sample Case 1, we can get the following details:  
![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/19506/1458521836-24039e7523-ScreenShot2016-03-21at6.08.08AM.png)  
  
Students 12299 and 34856 both created 6 challenges. Because 6 is the maximum number of challenges created, these students are included in the result.  
  
	WITH a AS(
		SELECT h.hacker_id, name, count(c.challenge_id) AS nums 
		FROM hackers h join challenges c ON	h.hacker_id = c.hacker_id 
		GROUP BY h.hacker_id,h.name) 
	SELECT hacker_id, name, nums 
	FROM a 
	WHERE nums NOT IN (
		SELECT nums FROM a WHERE nums < (
			SELECT max(nums) FROM a
		) 
		GROUP BY nums 
		HAVING count(nums) > 1 ) 
	ORDER BY nums desc, hacker_id;
